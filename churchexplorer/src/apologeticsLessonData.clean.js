    // Kalam: structure and support
    { type: 'content', title: 'The Kalam Cosmological Argument', content: [
      '1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause.',
      '2) The universe began to exist.',
      '3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.',
      'Modern cosmology (Big Bang, expansion of space, background radiation) supports premise 2. Philosophical arguments support a beginning as well.'
    ], highlight: 'If the universe began, it points to a Beginner.' },

    { type: 'content', title: "Why 'begins to exist' matters", content: [
      "The premise is not 'everything has a cause' but 'whatever begins to exist has a cause.'",
      "God is eternal and doesn't begin to exist, so He doesn't need a cause.",
      'The universe began‚Äîso it is reasonable to ask for a cause. This avoids the "Who made God?" objection.'
    ], highlight: 'Only things that begin need causes.' },

    { type: 'content', title: "Actual infinities and Hilbert's Hotel", content: [
      "If the past were actually infinite, we'd never arrive at today (you cannot traverse an actual infinite by successive addition).",
      "Hilbert's Hotel‚Äîa hotel with infinite rooms that is always full yet can still add guests‚Äîreveals paradoxes with actual infinities, suggesting an infinite regress of past events is impossible.",
      'A finite past implies a beginning to the universe.'
    ], highlight: 'A finite past implies a beginning.' },

    { type: 'quiz', question: 'Why doesn\'t the question "Who made God?" refute Kalam?', options: [
      'Because God is part of the universe and had a beginning',
      'Because the first premise only applies to things that begin to exist, and God did not begin',
      'Because we can\'t know anything about God'
    ], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "Kalam's first premise is 'Whatever begins to exist has a cause.' God is eternal and uncaused; the premise doesn‚Äôt apply to Him." },

    { type: 'fillblank', prompt: 'Whatever ______ to exist has a cause.', correctAnswer: 'begins', explanation: "The Kalam's first premise is 'Whatever begins to exist has a cause.'" },

    // From cause to attributes
    { type: 'content', title: 'What kind of cause?', content: [
      'If space, time, matter, and energy began, then the cause must be beyond space, time, matter, and energy‚Äîimmaterial, timeless, powerful.',
      'Two types of causes exist: impersonal conditions and personal agents. If impersonal conditions were eternal, the effect (a universe) would also be eternal. But the universe is not eternal.',
      'Therefore, the cause is best explained as a personal agent who can choose to create: a mind with will.'
    ], highlight: 'Timeless cause + non-eternal effect points to a personal Creator.' },

    // Lennox quote
    { type: 'content', title: 'Quote: John Lennox', content: [
      '‚ÄúNonsense remains nonsense, even when talked by world‚Äëfamous scientists.‚Äù',

    // Fine-tuning: content and activity
    { type: 'content', title: 'The Fine-Tuning Argument', content: [
      'The universe is fine‚Äëtuned for life with staggering precision. Life-permitting ranges for many constants are razor-thin.',
      '‚Ä¢ Gravity: if altered by 1 part in 10^40, stars would not form.',
      '‚Ä¢ Cosmological constant: exquisitely precise; tiny changes collapse or disperse the universe.',
      "‚Ä¢ Strong nuclear force, electron‚Äëproton ratio, carbon resonance‚Äîall set 'just right.'",
      'Taken together, these suggest design rather than accident.'

      { term: 'Strong nuclear force', definition: 'Binds nuclei; small changes prevent chemistry' },
      { term: 'Carbon resonance', definition: 'Energy level that enables carbon formation in stars' }
    ] },

    { type: 'quiz', question: 'Which explanation best fits widespread, independent fine‚Äëtuning across many constants?', options: [
      'Sheer chance, because improbable things happen all the time',
      'Design, because multiple precise values aligned simultaneously',
      'There is no fine‚Äëtuning; life just adapted'
    ], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Multiple, independent parameters landing in life-permitting ranges points to design as the best explanation.' },

    // Objections and replies
    { type: 'content', title: 'Common objections', content: [
      'Who made God? ‚Äî Only things that begin need causes; God is eternal.',
      'Multiverse? ‚Äî Speculative and itself requires finely tuned laws/initial conditions to generate life-permitting domains.',
  "We'll find a natural explanation ‚Äî That assumes naturalism; inference to the best explanation points to intelligence."
    ], highlight: 'Anticipate objections; answer with clarity and grace.' },

    { type: 'quiz', question: "Your friend says: 'Science explains everything. We don't need God.'", options: [
      "Science explains how things work, not why they exist. Who designed the laws science studies?",
      "That's ridiculous. Everything screams design!",
      "Yeah, you're probably right. Faith is just a feeling."
    ], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: "Science and God answer different questions. Science is the 'how,' God is the 'why.' Lennox: God no more competes with science than Henry Ford with combustion laws." },

    { type: 'quiz', question: 'What are the three steps of the Kalam?', options: [
      'God exists; the Bible says so; therefore it\'s true.',
      'Everything has a cause; God is first cause; God exists.',

      'The universe is complex; complexity needs design; God designed it.'
