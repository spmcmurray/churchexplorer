EXAMPLE FOR WEEK 1:

SUBJECT: Week 1: The Beginning - Early Christianity

Hi Sarah,

Welcome to Week 1 of your Church History journey!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📖 THIS WEEK: The Beginning - Early Christianity
How it all started

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Welcome to your journey through church history! This week, we'll explore how Christianity began and grew in its first few centuries. Don't worry if you're new to this - we'll start with the basics and build from there.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 KEY TOPICS THIS WEEK:

• The Apostolic Age (33 AD onward) - The first followers of Jesus
• How the early church organized itself
• The first major councils and why they mattered
• How Christianity spread across the Roman Empire

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 SIMPLE EXPLANATION

Think of the early church like a startup that grew rapidly. Jesus' followers started small in Jerusalem, but within a few centuries, Christianity had spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Early Christians had to figure out basic questions: What do we believe? How should we organize? What books belong in the Bible?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🤔 QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

1. What surprises you most about how Christianity began?
2. Why do you think Christianity spread so quickly in the ancient world?
3. How do you think the early church differs from churches today?

Take a few minutes to think about these. You might even want to journal your thoughts or discuss them with friends!

✅ THIS WEEK'S PRACTICE

This week, visit the Catholic and Orthodox sections in the app. These traditions trace their roots directly to the early church. Notice how they emphasize apostolic succession - the idea of an unbroken line of leadership from the apostles to today.
